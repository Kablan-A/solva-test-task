# SWAPI Web App

This is a React-based web application for exploring information on Star Wars entities (e.g., People, Planets, Starships) using data from the SWAPI (Star Wars API). The app includes reusable forms and display components for each entity type and implements React, Redux, and TypeScript for a smooth and type-safe development experience.

## Features

- Dynamic routing with React Router v6
- Custom reusable components for different entity types
- Form validation with Yup and react-hook-form
- State management with Redux
- SWAPI API integration with basic fetch calls
